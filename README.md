# Student-Placement-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Educational institutions and career placement cells struggle to efficiently predict which students are more likely to secure a job offer. Without data-driven insights, career counselors and recruiters rely on manual assessments, which may not always be accurate. This results in missed opportunities for students and inefficient hiring for companies.

This project falls under the Education Technology (EdTech) and HR Tech (Recruitment Analytics) domains, benefiting Universities & Colleges, Placement & Training Departments, Corporate Recruiters & HR Departments, EdTech & AI-Based Career Platforms.

The objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will be placed based on academic performance, internships, projects, certifications, soft skills, and other relevant factors. This will help educational institutions improve placement rates, assist recruiters in shortlisting candidates efficiently, and provide students with personalized career guidance.
